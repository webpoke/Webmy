Admin and Customer Messages After Order for WooCommerce: OrderConvo

== Description ==
OrderConvo is a lightweight plugin that allows vendors and customers to send messages after an order is placed. Admin/vendors and customers can send messages or even files to each other once the order is placed. Customers can access the OrderConvo message box from the `My Account -> Orders` page where each order will have there own message area. An Ajax-based, nice, and responsive message box is appended to the orders detail page to fit with every theme layout.

== Why use OrderConvo for effective Vendor-seller communication ==
[N-Media](https://najeebmedia.com) is in the WordPress/WooCommerce development for the last 12+ years and we got many feature requests. So **OrderConvo** is one of the most demanded requests. For example, when an order is placed, the customer and vendor should communicate or share
files only related to that order and customers can get the perfect product. Following are the
reasons why **OrderConvo** must be installed for your store:
= OrderConvo for Customer =
* Customer may want to change delivery address/date after order placed.
* Customer may want to change the order quantity after the order is placed.
* Customer may not be happy with the product/service and wants a revision or replacement rather than give you negative feedback.
= OrderConvo for WooCommerce Vendors =
* Vendors can send updates about order
* Vendors can send prototypes or samples (digital goods) rather than finally ship and get feedback

== OrderConvo for WooCommerce Add-ons ==
If you feel that OrderConvo Free or PRO versions are not enough for your needs, please see our [OrderConvo Add-ons](https://najeebmedia.com/wordpress-plugin/wooconvo-woocommerce/) and coming more
* **OrderConvo for WooCommerce Addon AWS S3** *Upload all attachments into AWS S3, just add your S3 credentials and that's all. Faster upload for all types of files especially big files.*
* **OrderConvo Addon Quick Message** *Admin can create message templates and reply with a single click with a pre-saved message. Work smarter and faster with QuickMessage Addon. Unlimited message templates.*
* **OrderConvo Addon Revisions** *Admin and Customer Messages After Order for WooCommerce Revision Addon allows a client to request revisions for the order. For example, a printing company may want its clients to request a revision for a design being sent by the vendor until the client approves it.*

It’s an ajax based chat solution to send and receive chat instantly. Chat is disabled by default but the admin can turn it on against single sessions to save server resources.*
